# Snap_PoliticalAds2020_Regression_Analyses
Constructing and interpreting simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models of the 2020 political ads on snap
## Background
Snapchat allows advertisers to create [political and election-related ads](https://www.snap.com/en-US/ad-policies/political) to promote candidates or specific parties, encourage people to vote, present ballot measures, and so on. All the ads are compliant with all applicable laws and regulations and the ads are encouraged to be positive rather than attacking other candidates' personal life. We will be looking the dataset in [Snap Political Ads Library](https://snap.com/en-US/political-ads) for 2020 and analyze how the number of times the ads has been viewed, or impressions, are associated to the amount the advertiser has spent, the displayed duration of the ads, and the ads' targeted gender in the United States. 
## Business Questions
How is the impression of the ads associated with the amount the advertiser spent over the campaign, the length of time the ads were displayed, and the targeted gender of the ads in the United States in 2020?
## Open Data
