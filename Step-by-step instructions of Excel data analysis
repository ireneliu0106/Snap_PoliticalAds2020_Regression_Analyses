1. Go to Snap Political Ads Library (https://www.snap.com/en-US/political-ads) to download the dataset for 2020. Save the dataset as an excel workbook.
2. Add filters on the column headers to only include data that has currency "USD" and non-blank end dates. Copy the data to a new worksheet "Cleaned Data". 
3. In the Cleaned Data worksheet, copy impression, spend, start date, end date, and gender columns and paste them into a new worksheet "Regression Data".
4. Highlight start date in the Regression Data worksheet, go to data -> text to columns -> delimited -> select space as delimiter to separate the date from time. Repeat this step for end date.
5. Disregard time, only substract the date in end date by the date in start date in a new column called "Days".
6. Go to the gender column and use an IF statement to denote both genders (represented by blank in the dataset) as 1 and single gender (female or male) as 0 in a new column "Both Genders?".
7. In the Regression Data worksheet, perform multiple linear regression analysis by going to data -> data analysis -> regression -> put the impresion columns as input y range and spend, days, and both genders columns as input x range. Select the labels box and save the output in a new worksheet "Regression Results".
8. Repeat the last step for only impression column as input y range and spend as input x range to perform simple linear regression analysis and save the output in a new worksheet "Regression Results-Spend".
9. In Regression Analysis worksheet, insert a scatter plot for impression as y and spend as x. Add trendline and display R square value and equation on the graph.
10. Go back to Regression Data worksheet and go to data -> data analysis -> correlation and put impression, spend, days, and both gender columns as input range. Select grouped by columns and labels in first row and save the daya in a new worksheet "Correlation".
